# MazeRunner
Mazerunner is a fun, fast-paced game that I developed using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery. (Note: this game is playable on PC, mobile, and tablet as of 09/02/2019).

The ambition behind the creation of this game is to demonstrate both my development skills (in JavaScript) as well as my mathematical competency (i.e. collision detection and character movement). 

Fun fact: the entire game concept is made up of only 3 divs!
