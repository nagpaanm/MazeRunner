# MazeRunner
A small game that I created using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery. This game can be played on my website: http://www.anmolnagpal.ca/content/MazeRunner/. (Note: this game is playable on both PC, mobile and tablet as of 09/02/2019)

The ambition behind the creation of this game is to demonstrate my programming mathematic skills (specifically in JavaScript) through the use of collision detection and character movement, while also showcasing my creativity (the entire game concept is made up of only 3 divs!) and my overall skills in application development.
