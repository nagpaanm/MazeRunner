# MazeRunner
A small game that I created using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery. This game can be played on my website: http://www.anmolnagpal.ca/content/MazeRunner/.

The ambition behind the creation of this game is to demonstrate my programming mathematic skills (specifically in JavaScript) through the use of collision detection and character movement, while also showcasing my creativity (the entire game concept is made up of only 3 divs!).
